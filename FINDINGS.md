## 1. h13/poly1 — Benchmark Candidate (Pipeline Score: 18/20)

**Date**: 2026-02-23. **Script**: [pipeline_h13_P1.py](pipeline_h13_P1.py).

The original benchmark for the pipeline. Smallest h¹¹ in the landscape, completely clean line bundles. Superseded in all metrics by h14/poly2 (320 clean, 26/26) but remains the standard test polytope.

### Geometry
- h¹¹ = 13, h²¹ = 16, χ = −6 (native 3-generation, no quotient needed)
- 18 toric coordinates, 17 rays, non-favorable (h¹¹_eff = 13)
- c₂ = [16, 2, 18, 18, 12, 6, −4, −2, −2, 2, −4, −4, −4]
- 101 intersection entries, 73 Mori cone generators, 87 SR ideal generators

### Divisor Structure
- **3 del Pezzo**: e₁ (dP₄), e₅ (dP₆), e₉ (dP₄)
- **1 K3-like**: e₄ (D³=0, c₂·D=12)
- **5 high-D³ rigid**: e₆, e₇, e₈, e₁₀, e₁₁, e₁₂ (D³ = 7–8)
- **3 rigid (D³<0)**: e₀, e₂, e₃
- All 13 divisors rigid (h¹·⁰ = h²·⁰ = 0)

### Swiss Cheese
e₁₂ (toric idx 17): τ = 10.0, V = 308,352, τ/V²ᐟ³ = 0.0022. Excellent LVS hierarchy.

### Line Bundles
- **11,054 total χ = ±3 bundles** (5,527 each sign)
- **25 completely clean**: h⁰ = 3, h¹ = h² = h³ = 0
- 76 with h⁰ ≥ 3, max h⁰ = 6
- **Zero nef bundles** (min Mori pairing = −19)

### Why It's the Best
1. Only polytope with BOTH h⁰ = 3 bundles AND Swiss cheese structure
2. 25 completely clean bundles (no vector-like pairs, no higher cohomology)
3. Smallest h¹¹ in the χ = −6 landscape → simplest geometric complexity
4. dP₆ divisor (e₅) → candidate for E₆ instanton effects

### Open Questions
- Stability of the 25 clean bundles (slope or Gieseker)?
- Can rank-4/5 bundles be built from these line bundles?
- Full fibration classification (K3, elliptic)?
- Does e₁₂ correspond to a blow-up of a del Pezzo?

## 2. h17/poly25 — F-Theory + Triple-Threat Champion (Pipeline Score: 26/26, 170 clean, 15 elliptic)

**Date**: 2026-02-23. **Script**: `python pipeline.py --h11 17 --poly 25`. **Output**: [results/pipeline_h17_P25_output.txt](results/pipeline_h17_P25_output.txt).

New record holder for elliptic fibrations — **15 elliptic fibrations** (50% more than the previous record of 10). Also has 6 K3 fibrations. Combined with Swiss cheese structure (τ=56) and 170 clean bundles, this is the only candidate that excels at heterotic, F-theory, AND Large Volume Scenario simultaneously — the "triple-threat."

### Geometry
- h¹¹ = 17, h²¹ = 20, χ = −6 (native 3-generation, no quotient needed)
- 19 toric coordinates, non-favorable

### Divisor Structure
- **2 del Pezzo**: e₂ (dP₇), e₃ (dP₈)
- **1 K3-like**
- **4 rigid**

### Swiss Cheese
τ = 56.0, ratio = 0.00370. Viable LVS hierarchy.

### Line Bundles
- **18,362 χ = ±3 bundles** (matching h17/poly63)
- **170 completely clean**: h⁰ = 3, h¹ = h² = h³ = 0
- 490 with h⁰ ≥ 3, max h⁰ = 8

### Fibrations
- **6 K3 fibrations** — tied for most of any candidate
- **15 elliptic fibrations** — **ALL-TIME RECORD**. 50% more than previous best (h17/poly63 at 10)

### Scorecard: 26/26 (PERFECT)
- χ = −6: 3/3 ✓
- |χ|/2 = 3 generations: 3/3 ✓
- h⁰ ≥ 3 exists: 3/3 ✓
- Clean bundles: 5/5 ✓ (170)
- Max h⁰: 2/2 ✓ (8)
- Swiss cheese: 3/3 ✓ (τ = 56.0)
- K3 fibrations: 2/2 ✓ (6)
- Elliptic fibrations: 2/2 ✓ (15!)
- del Pezzo divisors: 1/1 ✓ (2)
- D³ diversity: 1/1 ✓
- h¹¹ tractable: 1/1 ✓ (17)

### Why It's the Triple-Threat Champion
1. **15 elliptic fibrations** — all-time record. Each is a distinct F-theory compactification pathway with potential non-abelian gauge groups.
2. **6 K3 fibrations** — tied for most of any candidate. Combined with 15 ell, gives 21 total fibrations (far exceeding any other candidate).
3. **Swiss cheese τ = 56** — viable LVS moduli stabilization. Not the strongest (h15/poly61 has τ=14,300), but functional.
4. **170 clean bundles** — solid heterotic target space.
5. **Only candidate excelling at all three approaches** — heterotic (170 clean), F-theory (15 ell), and LVS (Swiss cheese).

### Comparison — Triple-Threat Candidates

| Metric | h17/poly25 | h16/poly63 | h17/poly8 | h16/poly11 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Score | 26/26 | 26/26 | 26/26 | 26/26 |
| Clean bundles | 170 | 78 | 180 | **298** |
| Elliptic fib. | **15** | 6 | 3 | 3 |

| dP divisors | 2 | 5 | 4 | 5 |
| Best for... | F-theory | Balanced | LVS | Heterotic |

### Open Questions
- Which of the 15 elliptic fibrations yield the richest gauge algebras (Kodaira classification)?
- Can the 6 K3 fibrations be leveraged for heterotic/F-theory duality constructions?
- Does the modest τ=56 suffice for realistic moduli stabilization, or is tuning needed?

## 2a. h17/poly63 — Former F-Theory Champion (Pipeline Score: 26/26, 218 clean)

**Date**: 2026-02-22. **Script**: `python pipeline.py --h11 17 --poly 63`. **Output**: [results/pipeline_h17_P63_output.txt](results/pipeline_h17_P63_output.txt).

The richest fibration structure of any candidate — 5 K3 + 10 elliptic fibrations. Max h⁰ = 40, the highest of any polytope scoring T2=45. Prime target for F-theory model building.

### Geometry
- h¹¹ = 17, h²¹ = 20, χ = −6 (native 3-generation, no quotient needed)
- 18 toric coordinates, 17 rays, non-favorable (h¹¹_eff = 13)
- c₂ = [36, 18, 2, 16, 18, 10, −4, 2, 6, 8, 8, −18, −6]
- 97 intersection entries, 65 Mori cone generators, 80 SR ideal generators
- SHA-256 fingerprint: 3cc2448f341e6e9a

### Divisor Structure
- **6 del Pezzo**: e₂ (dP₄), e₅ (dP₈), e₇ (dP₄), e₈ (dP₆), e₉ (dP₇), e₁₀ (dP₇)
- **1 K3-like**: e₀ (D³=0, c₂·D=36)
- **6 rigid**: e₁, e₃, e₄, e₆, e₁₁, e₁₂

### Swiss Cheese
e₁₂ (toric idx 17): τ = 84.0, V = 853,536, τ/V²ᐟ³ = 0.0093. Good LVS hierarchy.

### Line Bundles
- **14,458 total χ = ±3 bundles** (7,229 each sign)
- **218 completely clean**: h⁰ = 3, h¹ = h² = h³ = 0
- 922 with h⁰ ≥ 3, max h⁰ = 40
- **1 nef bundle** (the rarest finding — almost all χ=−6 bundles are non-nef)
- 61 distinct D³ values among clean bundles (range [−59, 59])

### Fibrations
- **5 K3 fibrations** — base P¹ directions: [0,1,1,0], [0,0,0,1], [0,0,1,1], [0,1,0,−1], [0,1,0,0]
- **10 elliptic fibrations** — the most of any fully-analyzed candidate. Rich 2D reflexive subpolytope structure in the dual.

### Why It's the F-Theory Champion
1. **10 elliptic fibrations** — more than any other analyzed polytope. Each is a distinct F-theory compactification pathway.
2. **6 del Pezzo divisors** — twice as many as h14/poly2. Each dP divisor supports non-perturbative E-type effects.
3. **Max h⁰ = 40** — extremely large global sections suggest deep bundle structure for rank-4/5 constructions.
4. **218 clean bundles with zero higher cohomology** — broad target space for heterotic embedding.

### Comparison with Heterotic Champion

| Metric | h14/poly2 | h17/poly63 | Winner |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Score | 26/26 | 26/26 | Tie |
| Clean bundles | **320** | 218 | h14/poly2 |

| Swiss cheese | **3 dirs** | 1 dir | h14/poly2 |
| h¹¹ | **14** | 17 | h14/poly2 |

### Open Questions
- Which of the 10 elliptic fibrations gives the richest gauge algebra from singular fibers?
- Can rank-4/5 bundles be built leveraging the 6 dP divisors?
- Does the single nef bundle have special significance?

## 2a′. h16/poly63 — Triple-Threat #2 (Pipeline Score: 26/26, 78 clean, τ=836)

**Date**: 2026-02-23. **Script**: `python pipeline.py --h11 16 --poly 63`. **Output**: [results/pipeline_h16_P63_output.txt](results/pipeline_h16_P63_output.txt).

Second-best triple-threat candidate. Strong across all three compactification approaches with particularly good LVS hierarchy (τ=836, 3rd overall) and 5 del Pezzo divisors.

### Geometry
- h¹¹ = 16, h²¹ = 19, χ = −6, non-favorable

### Divisor Structure
- **5 del Pezzo**: e₀ (dP₈), e₁ (dP₈), e₃ (dP₆), e₅ (dP₄), e₉ (dP₅)
- **2 K3-like**
- **6 rigid**

### Swiss Cheese
τ = 836.2, ratio = 0.04192. Third-best LVS hierarchy overall (after h15/poly61 at 14,300 and h17/poly8 at 2,208).

### Line Bundles
- **12,736 χ = ±3 bundles** (each sign)
- **78 completely clean**: h⁰ = 3, h¹ = h² = h³ = 0
- 584 with h⁰ ≥ 3, max h⁰ = 37

### Fibrations
- **4 K3 fibrations**
- **6 elliptic fibrations**

### Scorecard: 26/26 (PERFECT)
All 26 points scored. Loses nothing.

### Status
✅ Full pipeline complete. 26/26 score.

## 2a″. h16/poly53 — Second-Most Clean Bundles (Pipeline Score: 23/26, 300 clean)

**Date**: 2026-02-23. **Script**: `python pipeline.py --h11 16 --poly 53`. **Output**: [results/pipeline_h16_P53_output.txt](results/pipeline_h16_P53_output.txt).

Second-highest clean bundle count of any candidate (300, behind only h14/poly2 at 320). Rich fibration structure (5 K3 + 10 ell) and 6 dP divisors. The only weakness: **no Swiss cheese structure** → loses 3 LVS points.

### Geometry
- h¹¹ = 16, h²¹ = 19, χ = −6, non-favorable

### Divisor Structure
- **6 del Pezzo**: e₂ (dP₈), e₄ (dP₄), e₅ (dP₇), e₉ (dP₅), e₁₀ (dP₅), e₁₁ (dP₄), e₁₂ (dP₄)
- **0 K3-like**
- **10 rigid**

### Swiss Cheese
None found. This is the critical weakness.

### Line Bundles
- **18,362 χ = ±3 bundles** (each sign)
- **300 completely clean**: h⁰ = 3, h¹ = h² = h³ = 0
- 1,100 with h⁰ ≥ 3, max h⁰ = 16

### Fibrations
- **5 K3 fibrations**
- **10 elliptic fibrations**

### Scorecard: 23/26
- Swiss cheese: **0/3 ✗** (no Swiss cheese structure found)
- All other categories: full marks

### Why It Matters
300 clean bundles is tantalizing — nearly matching the heterotic champion. This is an excellent heterotic + F-theory candidate (5 K3 + 10 ell), but LVS moduli stabilization would require alternative approaches (e.g., KKLT).

### Status
✅ Full pipeline complete. 23/26 score.

## 2a‴. h19/poly16 — High-h¹¹ Candidate (Pipeline Score: 22/26, 86 clean)

**Date**: 2026-02-23. **Script**: `python pipeline.py --h11 19 --poly 16`. **Output**: [results/pipeline_h19_P16_output.txt](results/pipeline_h19_P16_output.txt).

Highest h¹¹ in the full pipeline set. Rich fibration structure (5 K3 + 10 ell) and 5 dP divisors, but loses points on Swiss cheese (none) and h¹¹ tractability (19 > 18).

### Geometry
- h¹¹ = 19, h²¹ = 22, χ = −6, non-favorable

### Divisor Structure
- **5 del Pezzo**
- **0 K3-like**
- **7 rigid**

### Line Bundles
- **86 completely clean**: h⁰ = 3, h¹ = h² = h³ = 0
- 564 with h⁰ ≥ 3, max h⁰ = 27

### Fibrations
- **5 K3 fibrations**
- **10 elliptic fibrations**

### Scorecard: 22/26
- Swiss cheese: **0/3 ✗**
- h¹¹ tractable (≤18): **0/1 ✗** (h¹¹=19)

### Status
✅ Full pipeline complete. 22/26 score.

## 2b. h17/poly8 — Second-Best T2=45 Scorer (159 clean)

**Date**: 2026-02-24. **Script**: [tier2_screen.py](tier2_screen.py).

Second highest clean h⁰ = 3 count among all polytopes scoring T2 = 45 (maximum). Strong fibration structure with balanced K3/elliptic content.

### Key Data
- h¹¹ = 17, h²¹ = 20, χ = −6, non-favorable (h¹¹_eff = 13)
- 159 clean h⁰ = 3 line bundles
- 558 with h⁰ ≥ 3, max h⁰ = 13
- 12,928 total χ = ±3 bundles
- 3 K3 fibrations, 3 elliptic fibrations
- D³ range: [−60, 108], 152 distinct values

### Why It Matters
Among the 30 polytopes achieving the maximum T2 score, h17/poly8 has the second most clean bundles (159). Its balanced fibration structure (3 K3 + 3 elliptic) makes it a strong candidate for both heterotic and F-theory embeddings. Clean bundle count 6× that of h13/poly1.

### Status
Needs full pipeline run (Stages 1–4 deep analysis + scorecard).

## 2b′. h15/poly61 — LVS Champion (Pipeline Score: 25/26, 110 clean, τ=14,300)

**Date**: 2026-02-22 (discovered), 2026-02-23 (full pipeline). **Script**: `python pipeline.py --h11 15 --poly 61`. **Output**: [results/pipeline_h15_P61_output.txt](results/pipeline_h15_P61_output.txt).

Discovered in the expanded h15 scan (polytope index 61, invisible to original limit=100 scan). Now fully analyzed. **Best Large Volume Scenario candidate by a factor of 6.5×** — Swiss cheese τ = 14,300 vs previous best 2,208 (h17/poly8).

### Geometry
- h¹¹ = 15, h²¹ = 18, χ = −6, non-favorable
- SHA-256 fingerprint: 7ffc1e727a82fac4

### Divisor Structure
- **0 del Pezzo** (only weakness — loses 1 scorecard point)
- **1 K3-like**
- **6 rigid**
- 2 Swiss cheese directions, best: **τ = 14,300.0**, ratio = 0.04822

### Line Bundles
- **13,256 total χ = ±3 bundles**
- **110 completely clean**: h⁰ = 3, h¹ = h² = h³ = 0
- 338 with h⁰ ≥ 3, max h⁰ = 4 (modest but practical)
- 40 distinct D³ values among clean bundles (range [−52, 52])

### Fibrations
- **3 K3 fibrations**
- **3 elliptic fibrations**

### Scorecard: 25/26
- χ = −6: 3/3 ✓
- |χ|/2 = 3 generations: 3/3 ✓
- h⁰ ≥ 3 exists: 3/3 ✓
- Clean bundles: 5/5 ✓ (110)
- Max h⁰: 2/2 ✓ (4)
- Swiss cheese: 3/3 ✓ (τ = 14,300.0!)
- K3 fibrations: 2/2 ✓ (3)

- del Pezzo divisors: **0/1 ✗** (0 candidates)
- D³ diversity: 1/1 ✓ (40 distinct)
- h¹¹ tractable: 1/1 ✓ (15)

### Why It's the LVS Champion
1. **τ = 14,300** — 6.5× the previous best (h17/poly8 at τ = 2,208). The strongest LVS hierarchy of any candidate.
2. **Discovered only through scan expansion** — validates the decision to go beyond limit=100
3. **h¹¹ = 15** — lower than most top candidates → simpler moduli stabilization
4. **110 clean bundles → 7 more than T2 predicted** (103 → 110, 7% uplift from full enumeration)
5. **Balanced fibration structure** (3 K3 + 3 ell) — viable for both heterotic and F-theory

### Comparison with Other Top Candidates

| Metric | h15/poly61 | h17/poly8 | h14/poly2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Score | 25/26 | 26/26 | 26/26 |
| Clean bundles | 110 | 180 | **320** |
| Swiss τ | **14,300** | 2,208 | 58.5 |
| dP divisors | 0 | 4 | 3 |

| h¹¹ | **15** | 17 | 14 |

### Open Questions
- Can the absence of dP divisors be compensated by other instanton sources?
- Does the extreme τ translate to viable moduli stabilization in a concrete flux model?
- Are rank-4/5 monad bundles available despite 0 dP divisors?

### Status
✅ Full pipeline complete. 25/26 score.

## 2b″. h15/poly127 — Highest T1 Score in Expanded Scan

**Date**: 2026-02-22. **Discovered by**: `scan_parallel.py` expanded h15 scan.

Highest T1 screening score among all new h15 polytopes: score 40, max h⁰ = 17, 8 del Pezzo divisors (most of any h15 candidate). Swiss cheese structure confirmed.

### Key Data (T1 screen)
- h¹¹ = 15, h²¹ = 18, χ = −6, favorable
- max h⁰ = 17, T1 score = 40
- 8 del Pezzo divisors (highest count at h15)
- Swiss cheese: τ = 193.5, ratio = 0.0035

### Status
Through T1 screen. Needs T2 + full pipeline.

---

## 2c. h14/poly2 — Heterotic Champion (Pipeline Score: 26/26, 320 clean)

**Date**: 2026-02-22. **Script**: `python pipeline.py --h11 14 --poly 2`. **Output**: [results/pipeline_h14_P2_output.txt](results/pipeline_h14_P2_output.txt).

Most clean h⁰ = 3 bundles of any polytope analyzed. Lowest h¹¹ (14) among top candidates. The strongest candidate for heterotic string compactification.

### Geometry
- h¹¹ = 14, h²¹ = 17, χ = −6, non-favorable (h¹¹_eff = 13)
- SHA-256 fingerprint: f6c14152f6f3b812

### Key Data (full pipeline)
- **320 clean h⁰ = 3 line bundles** (most of any candidate)
- 828 with h⁰ ≥ 3, max h⁰ = 13
- 14,608 total χ = ±3 bundles
- 3 K3 fibrations, 3 elliptic fibrations
- 61 distinct D³ values (range [−63, 63])
- 3 del Pezzo (dP₄, dP₄, dP₇), 2 K3-like, 6 rigid
- 3 Swiss cheese directions (best: e₉ τ=58.5, ratio=0.001)
- 1 nef bundle

### Why It's the Heterotic Champion
1. **320 clean bundles** — 12.8× more than h13/poly1, 1.5× more than h17/poly63
2. **h¹¹ = 14** — lowest among top candidates → simplest moduli stabilization
3. **3 Swiss cheese directions** — strongest LVS structure of any candidate
4. **L = O(±e₀)** — simplest clean bundle is a single-divisor 3-generation model

### Status
✅ Full pipeline complete. 26/26 score.

## 2c. h17/poly96 — Extreme max h⁰ = 65 (T2=39)

**Date**: 2026-02-24. Discovered in Codespace T2 batch.

The highest max h⁰ ever recorded on a χ = −6 polytope.

### Key Data
- h¹¹ = 17, h²¹ = 20, χ = −6, non-favorable (h¹¹_eff = 13)
- 227 clean h⁰ = 3 bundles
- 930 with h⁰ ≥ 3, **max h⁰ = 65**
- 10,208 total χ = ±3 bundles
- 2 K3 fibrations, 1 elliptic fibration

### Why It Matters
max h⁰ = 65 means very large global sections exist — this could enable exotic bundle constructions not possible on lower-h⁰ polytopes. The lower T2 score (39) is due to fewer fibrations, but the raw cohomological richness is unmatched.

---

## 3. Polytope 40 (h15/poly40) — Proven Dead End for Line Bundles

**Date**: 2026-02-22. **Scripts**: dragon_slayer series (40.py through 40i.py).

Extensively investigated. 7-script audit trail proves max h⁰ = 2. Do not re-investigate this polytope for line bundle h⁰ = 3.

### Geometry
- h¹¹ = 15, h²¹ = 18, χ = −6 (native 3-generation)
- 11 del Pezzo divisors (dP₁ through dP₇), 1 K3-like
- Swiss cheese: τ = 4.0, V = 17,506
- Z₂ symmetry, 116 three-divisor χ = 3 bundles

### The h⁰ = 2 Proof
Method: Koszul exact sequence on the CY hypersurface + lattice point counting on the ambient toric 4-fold + toric h¹ correction.

For ALL 119 χ = +3 bundles (coefficients up to ±3, 1–4 nonzero entries):
- **Max h⁰(X, D) = 2**
- h¹(V, D+K_V) = 0 for ALL bundles → Koszul formula is exact
- No Kodaira vanishing pathway (zero nef+big bundles; closest to nef: min Mori pairing = −2)
- cohomCalg blocked (97 SR generators > 64 limit)

### The Pipeline Score Problem
Original pipeline script hardcoded `proven_h0_3 = True` with the comment "We KNOW these exist from previous analysis" — without verification. This was the fabricated 20th point in the "20/20" score. Corrected score: 10/20 (see Scorecard in [CATALOGUE.md](CATALOGUE.md)).

### Still Interesting For
- Higher-rank vector bundles (monad construction) where h¹(V) = 3 might be achievable
- F-theory models using its K3/elliptic fibrations
- Teaching example of rigorous cohomology computation on toric CY3

## 4. Ample Champion (h11=2, h21=29, χ=−54) — Quotient Fails

**Date**: 2026-02-20. **Script**: [ample_champion_quotient.py](ample_champion_quotient.py).

### What Was Attempted
Find a freely-acting Z₃×Z₃ quotient to get χ = −54/9 = −6 (3 generations).

### What Works
- Z₃×Z₃ symmetry genuinely exists: g₁ = (0 4 5), g₂ = (1 2 3), commuting, order 3
- "Diagonal" elements g₁ᵃg₂ᵇ (a≠0 AND b≠0) act freely on the CY

### What Fails
- **Pure g₁, g₂ have fixed curves**: 2D fixed loci on the ambient toric variety intersect the CY in curves. Numerically confirmed: |P|² ≈ 10⁻⁸⁸ on fixed locus.
- **Full Z₃×Z₃ quotient is singular**: orbifold singularities along two fixed curve images
- χ = −6 is never achieved without resolution, which changes χ

### Salvaged
- Diagonal Z₃ acts freely → χ = −54/3 = −18 → 9 generations. Not 3, but documented.
- The orbifold path (resolve singularities) remains theoretically open but is a much harder calculation.

## 5. General Landscape Facts

### Non-Favorable Dominance
705/1025 (69%) of χ = −6 polytopes are non-favorable. These have h¹¹_eff < h¹¹, meaning the toric divisor basis doesn't span H¹·¹. Before Bug B-11 was fixed, all of these were invisible. Every top-20 T2 candidate except h15/poly33 is non-favorable.

### Fibration Universality
Every χ = −6 polytope in our scan at h¹¹ ≥ 13 has both K3 and elliptic fibrations. This is expected (generic CY3 at these Hodge numbers are fibered) but means fibration existence is not a useful discriminator. What varies is the *number* and *type* of fibrations — the top candidates have 3–6 of each.

### Bundle Abundance Distribution
From the full scan v2 (1,025 polytopes), max h⁰ distribution:

| max h⁰ | Count | Cumulative % |
|---------|-------|-------------- |
| 1 | 316 | 31% |
| 2 | 76 | 38% |
| 3 | 249 | 62% |
| 4–6 | 209 | 83% |
| 7–10 | 87 | 91% |
| 11–20 | 52 | 96% |
| 21–56 | 36 | 100% |

62% of polytopes have max h⁰ ≥ 3 — the geometric prerequisites for 3-generation models are abundant. The bottleneck is Stages 5–7 (non-abelian bundles, chirality, moduli stabilization).

## 6. Self-Mirror Polytope (h11=20, h21=20, χ=0)

**Date**: 2026-02-19. **Script**: various (archive/).

Not a 3-generation candidate (χ = 0), but mathematically notable:
- Self-mirror CY with h¹¹ = h²¹ = 20
- 3 K3 fibrations, 3 elliptic fibrations (highly symmetric structure)
- K3 fiber directions: [0,1,0,−1], [1,0,0,−1], [1,−1,0,0]
- Potential for F-theory compactifications (generations from brane geometry, not χ)
- Undocumented in recent systematic scans

Parked as a curiosity. May be relevant for F-theory path.

## 7. Expanded Scan Results (h15 complete, h16 in progress)

**Date**: 2026-02-22. **Script**: [scan_parallel.py](scan_parallel.py).

### Motivation

The original scan (`scan_chi6_h0.py`) capped at `limit=100` polytopes per h¹¹ value. This was fine for h13 (3 polytopes) and h14 (22), but left the vast majority of h15–17 unscanned. The expanded scan uses `scan_parallel.py` (4-worker multiprocessing) to cover them fully.

### h15 — 553/553 complete

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Polytopes scanned | 553 (100%) |
| Hits (h⁰≥3) | 333 (60%) |
| Runtime | 9.2 min |
| Throughput | 1.0 poly/s |

New candidates discovered beyond original limit=100:
- **h15/poly 127**: max h⁰=17, 8 dP divisors, Swiss cheese (T1 score=40)
- **h15/poly 214**: max h⁰=15, 7 dP divisors, Swiss cheese (T1 score=40)
- **h15/poly 61**: **103 clean h⁰=3 bundles** (T2 #5 overall)
- **h15/poly 248**: max h⁰=16, Swiss cheese
- **h15/poly 94**: 36 clean bundles, 4 K3 + 4 elliptic fibrations
- 257 total new hits (poly index ≥ 100)

### h16 — 5,180/5,180 complete

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Polytopes scanned | 5,180 (100%) |
| Hits (h⁰≥3) | 1,811 (35%) |
| Runtime | 52.9 min |
| Throughput | 1.6 poly/s |

T1→T1.5→T2 screening on top 30 hits:
- **T1**: 30 screened → 17/30 Swiss cheese. Best: h16/poly329 (score=41, max h⁰=15)
- **T1.5**: 20 screened → 19/20 T2-worthy (17s)
- **T2**: 20 screened → all 20 ★★★, 5 scored T2=45 (maximum). Best overall: h15/poly61 (T2=45, 103 clean)

New T2-notable from expanded scan:
- **h19/poly16**: T2=45, 69 clean, max h⁰=27, 5 K3 + 6 elliptic fibrations
- **h18/poly32**: T2=45, 49 clean, max h⁰=30, 4 K3 + 4 ell
- **h17/poly53**: T2=45, 45 clean, 3 K3 + 3 ell
- **h15/poly94**: T2=45, 36 clean, 4 K3 + 4 ell

### h17 — 38,735/38,735 complete

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Polytopes scanned | 38,735 (100%) |
| T0.25 hits (h⁰≥3) | 10,624 (27.4%) |
| Deep-analyzed (Stage 1, top 200) | 200 |
| Fiber-classified (Stage 2) | 193 |
| Score 26/26 | **87** |
| SM gauge group (100%) | 193/193 |
| SU(5) GUT candidates | 166/193 (86%) |
| Runtime | 3 min (Codespace, 3 workers) |

This is a dramatic scaling jump — **87 perfect-score polytopes** at h17 vs. 19 at h11≤16 combined. The h17 landscape is the richest single Hodge number for χ=−6 candidate physics. See §10 for the full h17 analysis.

### h18 — in progress

~195,000 polytopes. T0.25 complete (100K→29,984 passes, 30%). T1 running on Hetzner (Docker, 14 workers): 5,745/29,984 (19%). ETA ~42 hrs.

### Impact on the Screening Pipeline

The expanded scan has fundamentally changed the leaderboard — h15/poly61 was discovered, fast-tracked through all tiers, and scored **25/26 on full pipeline** with τ=14,300. 36 total T2 entries now span h13–h19. The expanded h16 scan added 20 new T2 candidates, all quality-rated ★★★. This validates expanding the scan coverage as the most productive strategy for finding new physics candidates.

## 8. GL=12 / D₆ Polytope — Picard-Fuchs and Yukawa Study

**Date**: 2026-02-23. **Scripts**: [picard_fuchs.py](picard_fuchs.py). **Reference**: [GL12_GEOMETRY.md](GL12_GEOMETRY.md).

### Motivation

Among the 104 Hodge pairs with χ = −6, the polytope at `fetch_polytopes(h11=17, h21=20, lattice='N')` index 37 has the **largest lattice automorphism group**: |GL(Δ)| = 12, isomorphic to D₆ (dihedral group of the hexagon). This symmetry reduces the 20 complex structure moduli to just 6 invariant deformations, making Picard-Fuchs computation tractable.

### Key Results

**GKZ System:**
- A-matrix: 5×23 (from 23 dual lattice points), rank 5, β=(−1,0,0,0,0)
- Integer kernel: 18-dimensional
- D₆ orbit compression: 8 orbits on Δ*, rank(Ā)=2 → **6 invariant complex structure moduli** (h²¹_inv=6)
- 6 orbit-compressed Mori coordinates z₁…z₆ defining the invariant moduli space

**Closed-Form Period:**
- CT[P^k] = Σ_{a,γ} k!·(r−γ)! / [a!²·(γ+a)!·β!·γ!·j!³]
- 501 exact coefficients computed in 38 seconds
- First non-trivial: c₃=6, c₄=72, c₅=540 (c₅₀₀ has 469 digits)

**D₆-Invariant Yukawa Couplings:**
- 26 non-zero entries from 283 raw triple intersection numbers
- Two-sector structure: Sector A {O1,O3,O4,O5} (19 couplings) + Sector B {O2,O6} (4 couplings) + 1 cross-coupling κ(O1,O2,O3)=18
- Invariant c₂ numbers: O1=68, O2=36, O3=4, O4=12, O5=12, O6=−12

**Coordinate Issue:**
- PF in z=1/ψ (1-parameter model) has polynomial degree ≈ Vol(Δ*) = 72 — confirmed intractable by modular Gaussian elimination over 501 terms
- Resolution: use the 6 Mori coordinates z₁…z₆

### What Remains
- Quantum Yukawa corrections (Gromov-Witten invariants from instanton sums)
- Physical prepotential computation

### PF Operators (completed)

*Added 2026-02-23. See [GL12_GEOMETRY.md](GL12_GEOMETRY.md) §"Explicit PF Operators" for full details.*

The GKZ PF system was successfully derived in Mori θ-coordinates:
- **6 box operators** □₁–□₆ (degrees 3, 9, 2, 18, 6, 3) acting on the period ω₀
- **S_α mapping**: 8 orbit theta-operators expressed in 6 Mori θ-operators
- **9,366/9,366 GKZ recurrence checks pass** (verified to |n| ≤ 5)
- **1-parameter ODE** (z₁-axis): [(θ+1)³ + t(3θ+1)(3θ+2)(3θ+3)]ω = 0
- **Hypergeometric identification**: ₃F₂([1/3,2/3,1];[1,1];27t), AESZ #1
- This is the period of the mirror family of cubic curves in ℙ² (elliptic curve family)

## 9. Complete Pipeline Survey — 37 T2=45 Candidates (B-24)

**Date**: 2026-02-23. **Script**: `pipeline.py`.

All 37 polytopes scoring T2=45 (the maximum tier-2 score) have been analyzed with the full 26-point pipeline. This represents the complete set of top candidates from the χ=−6 landscape at h¹¹ = 13–19.

### Score Distribution

| Score | Count | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 26/26 | **19** | h15/poly94, h14/poly2, h16/poly11, h16/poly86 |
| 25/26 | 5 | h17/poly53, h17/poly51, h19/poly67, h17/poly96, h15/poly61 |
| 23/26 | 10 | h16/poly53, h17/poly9, h15/poly23, h16/poly22 |
| 22/26 | 2 | h18/poly32, h19/poly16 |
| 18/20 | 1 | h13/poly1 (old pipeline format) |

### Top 10 by Clean Bundle Count

| Rank | Candidate | Score | Clean | τ_SC | K3 | Ell |
|------|-----------|-------|-------|------|----|-----|
| 1 | **h17/poly53** | 25/26 | **418** | 1,016 | 3 | 3 |
| 2 | **h15/poly94** | 26/26 | **380** | 241 | 4 | 6 |
| 3 | h17/poly51 | 25/26 | 340 | 210 | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | h14/poly2 | 26/26 | 320 | 58 | 3 | 3 |
| 5 | h19/poly67 | 25/26 | 312 | 24 | 3 | 3 |
| 6 | h18/poly32 | 22/26 | 308 | — | 4 | 6 |
| 7 | h16/poly53 | 23/26 | 300 | — | 5 | 10 |
| 8 | h16/poly11 | 26/26 | 298 | 150 | 3 | 3 |
| 9 | h17/poly96 | 25/26 | 252 | 252 | 2 | 1 |
| 10 | h16/poly86 | 26/26 | 224 | 1,536 | 4 | 6 |

### Records

- **Most clean bundles (any score)**: h17/poly53 — 418 clean h⁰=3 bundles
- **Most clean bundles (26/26)**: h15/poly94 — 380 clean bundles (surpasses h14/poly2's 320)
- **Best τ (Swiss cheese)**: h15/poly61 — τ=14,300 (LVS champion)
- **Best τ among 26/26**: h15/poly25 — τ=5,255
- **Most elliptic fibrations**: h17/poly25, h17/poly45 — 15 each
- **Most K3 fibrations**: h17/poly25, h17/poly45 — 6 each

### 23/26 Pattern

All 10 polytopes scoring 23/26 fail the same 3 Swiss cheese / LVS checkpoints. These are geometrically viable 3-generation candidates whose Kähler cone does not admit the large-τ / small-τ hierarchy required for Large Volume Scenario moduli stabilization. They remain valid for other stabilization mechanisms (KKLT, racetrack, etc.).

## 10. h17 Automated Landscape Scan — 87 Perfect-Score Polytopes (B-19/B-28)

**Date**: 2026-02-25. **Script**: `auto_scan.py --h11 17 --skip-t025 --top 200 -w 3`.

The first fully automated deep scan of a single Hodge number using `auto_scan.py`. The h17 landscape (h¹¹=17, h²¹=20) turns out to be spectacularly rich — **87 polytopes achieve a perfect 26/26 score**, more than 4× the combined total from h11≤16. Every single fiber-analyzed polytope (193/193) contains the Standard Model gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1).

### Pipeline Summary

| Stage | Input | Output | Time |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| T0.25 pre-filter | 38,735 polytopes | 10,624 passes (27.4%) | (prior scan) |
| Top-200 selection | 10,624 passes | 200 (max_h0 cutoff ≥ 10) | — |
| Stage 1: Deep analysis | 200 polytopes | 200 scored | ~2 min |
| Stage 2: Fiber classification | 193 with fibrations | 193 gauge algebras | ~30s |
| **Total** | **38,735** | **200 ranked** | **3.0 min** |

### Score Distribution

| Score | Count | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 26/26 | **87** | Perfect — all criteria met |
| 25/26 | 26 | Missing 1 point (usually dP diversity or ell count) |
| 23/26 | 64 | No Swiss cheese (−3 LVS points) |
| 22/26 | 19 | No Swiss cheese + 1 other weakness |
| ≤21 | 4 | Multiple weaknesses |

### Gauge Group Results

| Metric | Count | Rate |
|--------|-------|------|
| SM gauge (SU3×SU2×U1) | 193 | **100%** |
| SU(5) GUT | 166 | 86% |
| E₇ or E₈ factors | 46 | 24% |

The 100% SM rate is remarkable — at h17, the toric geometry is rich enough that *every* polytope with good line bundle cohomology also supports Standard Model gauge factors through its elliptic fibrations.

### Category Champions

#### Triple-Threats (clean≥25, ell≥6, Swiss cheese)

These polytopes excel at heterotic (clean bundles), F-theory (elliptic fibrations), AND LVS (Swiss cheese) simultaneously:

| Poly | Clean | Ell | K3 | τ | GUT | Best Gauge |
|------|-------|-----|-----|---|-----|------------|
| **P767** | 59 | 10 | 5 | 1.5 | ★ | su(2)×su(4)×su(2)×su(3)×su(6) |
| **P1033** | 35 | 11 | 6 | 64 | ★ | su(2)×su(4)²×su(2)×su(3)×su(2) |
| **P1180** | 34 | 6 | 5 | 564 | ★ | su(5)×su(8)/e₇ |
| **P2297** | 33 | 8 | 5 | 28 | ★ | su(2)×su(6)² |
| **P894** | 33 | 6 | 4 | 110 | ★ | su(2)²×su(4)×su(5)×su(2) |
| **P860** | 31 | 6 | 5 | 1,139 | ★ | su(4)×su(3)×su(4)×su(3) |
| **P2338** | 25 | 11 | 6 | 3,750 | ★ | su(3)×su(5)×su(6) |
| **P1377** | 25 | 8 | 5 | 300 | ★ | su(4)×su(5)×su(2)×su(4)×su(2) |

**P767** is the standout — most clean bundles (59), 10 elliptic fibrations, 5 K3 fibrations, GUT-viable. Its only weakness is a low τ (1.5), meaning LVS would need fine-tuning. For a triple-threat that also has strong LVS, **P2338** (τ=3,750, 11 ell, 25 clean) or **P860** (τ=1,139, 6 ell, 31 clean, 8 dP) are better balanced.

#### F-Theory GUT Champions (ell≥8, GUT★)

| Poly | Ell | K3 | Clean | τ | Best Gauge |
|------|-----|-----|-------|---|------------|
| **P695** | **15** | 6 | 22 | 54 | su(2)×su(4)×su(2)×su(3)×su(6) |
| P1033 | 11 | 6 | 35 | 64 | su(2)×su(4)²×su(2)×su(3)×su(2) |
| P2338 | 11 | 6 | 25 | 3,750 | su(3)×su(5)×su(6) |
| P1471 | 11 | 6 | 24 | 798 | su(4)×su(2)×su(6)×su(2) |
| P13144 | 11 | 6 | 20 | 1,554 | su(4)²×su(2)⁴ |
| P5030 | 11 | 6 | 7 | 600 | su(5)×su(3)×su(5)×su(2) |
| P767 | 10 | 5 | 59 | 1.5 | su(2)×su(4)×su(2)×su(3)×su(6) |

**P695** holds the all-time record with **15 elliptic fibrations** — same as the previously-known h17/poly25, but now confirmed with full gauge algebra classification. The cluster of 6 polytopes with 11 elliptic fibrations is new territory; P2338 is particularly notable with τ=3,750 (strong LVS).

#### LVS Champions (τ > 1,000)

| Poly | τ | Clean | Ell | GUT | Best Gauge |
|------|---|-------|-----|-----|------------|
| **P340** | **8,608** | 13 | 1 | ★ | su(7)×su(6) |
| P985 | 6,440 | 25 | 4 | ★ | su(3)×su(8)/e₇×su(4) |
| P902 | 6,003 | 25 | 3 | ★ | su(6)×su(7) |
| P2338 | 3,750 | 25 | 11 | ★ | su(3)×su(5)×su(6) |
| P17 | 3,166 | 26 | 0 | — | — |
| P270 | 2,546 | 27 | 1 | — | su(2)×su(3)²×su(2)² |
| P1311 | 2,310 | 19 | 1 | ★ | su(2)×su(5)×su(7) |
| P8 | 2,208 | 25 | 3 | ★ | su(3)²×su(7) |
| P13144 | 1,554 | 20 | 11 | ★ | su(4)²×su(2)⁴ |
| P860 | 1,139 | 31 | 6 | ★ | su(4)×su(3)×su(4)×su(3) |

**P340** has τ=8,608 — the best h17 LVS hierarchy, though still below the all-time record of h15/poly61 at τ=14,300. **P2338** (τ=3,750) uniquely combines top-tier LVS with 11 ell fibrations and GUT viability.

#### Heterotic Champions (clean≥40)

| Poly | Clean | h⁰ | dP | Ell | τ | GUT | Best Gauge |
|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|---|-----|------------|
| **P767** | **59** | 17 | 3 | 10 | 1.5 | ★ | su(2)×su(4)×su(2)×su(3)×su(6) |
| P2548 | 54 | 10 | 7 | 4 | 0 | ★ | su(5)×su(8)/e₇ |
| P1040 | 50 | 16 | 6 | 1 | 0 | — | su(3)×su(4)×su(2)×su(4) |
| P14261 | 46 | 22 | 6 | 4 | 0 | ★ | su(3)×su(9)/e₈×su(3) |
| P53 | 45 | 10 | 0 | 3 | 1,016 | — | su(3)×su(4)×su(2)×su(3) |
| P883 | 43 | 10 | 6 | 4 | 0 | ★ | su(9)/e₈×su(3) |
| P389 | 41 | 10 | 3 | 1 | 186 | — | su(2)×su(3)×su(4)×su(2)×su(3) |

**P767** (59 clean) is the h17 heterotic champion and exceeds the previous h17 record-holder P53 (now confirmed at 45 clean by auto_scan). Note that the all-time heterotic champion h17/poly53 (418 clean from old full-pipeline analysis) was not in the top-200 by max_h0 — it likely ranks lower by that metric but has exceptional depth at h⁰=3. The auto_scan's top-200 selection biases toward high max_h0, which correlates with but doesn't perfectly predict clean bundle count.

#### E-Type Gauge Factors

24% of analyzed polytopes (46/193) have E₇ or E₈ gauge factors — these are particularly interesting for GUT model building since E₈ is the natural gauge group of heterotic string theory:

| Poly | Score | Clean | Gauge |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| P251 | 26 | 38 | su(4) × su(9)/e₈ |
| P1096 | 26 | 35 | su(4) × su(8)/e₇ |
| P1180 | 26 | 34 | su(5) × su(8)/e₇ |
| P923 | 26 | 32 | su(5) × su(9)/e₈ |
| P2828 | 26 | 30 | su(3) × su(8)/e₇ × su(4) |

### Cross-Reference with Prior Leaderboard

The previously known h17 candidates from the T2 pipeline have been re-ranked in the auto_scan:

| Old Name | Poly | Old Clean | Auto Clean | Auto Rank | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|------------|-----------|-------|
| h17/poly63 | P63 | 218 | 14 | 81 | Different analysis depth (full vs auto) |
| h17/poly53 | P53 | 418 | 45 | 88 | Not in top-200 by max_h0 |
| h17/poly25 | P25 | 170 | — | >200 | Below max_h0 cutoff of 10 |

The apparent drop in clean bundle counts is because auto_scan analyzes top-200 *by max_h0*, not by clean count. The old pipeline used full `min_h0=3` enumeration (much slower). The key insight: auto_scan efficiently identifies the *different* leaders — polytopes like P767 (59 clean, 10 ell) that were missed by the old pipeline's manual candidate selection.

### Summary

h17 is the **richest single Hodge number** in the χ=−6 landscape:
- **87 perfect scores** (26/26) — more than all lower h¹¹ values combined

## 11. Automorphism Group Scan — Symmetry vs. Three-Generation Tension (B-21)

**Date**: 2026-02-26. **Script**: [scan_automorphisms.py](scan_automorphisms.py). **Data**: [results/aut_scan.log](results/aut_scan.log).

### Motivation

An external analysis proposed that the GL=12 polytope's D₆ (dihedral-6) symmetry group could constrain Yukawa textures via a 2+1 generation splitting (E₁⊕A₁ irrep). This required testing whether **any** 3-generation polytopes have nontrivial discrete symmetries — a "binary gate" test before investing in representation-theoretic analysis.

Additionally, the GL=12 polytope (h17/P37) was conclusively falsified for line bundle phenomenology: across all 1,720 χ=−6 bundles, **max h⁰ = 1** — zero clean h⁰=3 bundles exist. The D₆ line bundle Yukawa program is dead.

### Method

Computed `p.automorphisms()` (polytope automorphism group) for:
1. All **592 top-200 candidates** across h15/h16/h17 (those appearing in auto_scan results)
2. All polytopes at each h-value with |Aut|>1, cross-referenced with scan CSVs for max_h0 and h0_3_count

### Key Results

**Among 592 top candidates:**
- 539 (91%) have trivial |Aut| = 1
- 49 (8%) have |Aut| = 2 (Z₂)
- 4 (1%) have |Aut| = 4 (Z₂×Z₂ or Z₄)
- **Maximum |Aut| = 4** — no D₆, A₄, or larger flavor symmetries

**Across ALL polytopes (h15+h16+h17) with |Aut|>1 AND h⁰≥3:**
- **532 polytopes total** (46 at h15, 112 at h16, 374 at h17)
- |Aut| distribution: 511× Z₂, 19× Z₄-class, 2× |Aut|=8

### The Symmetry-vs-h⁰ Tension

**Confirmed**: Higher polytope symmetry anti-correlates with h⁰ diversity.
- GL=12 (|Aut|=12): max_h⁰ = 1, zero h⁰=3 bundles
- |Aut|=8: max_h⁰ = 3, only 2-4 h⁰=3 bundles
- |Aut|=4: max_h⁰ up to 13, up to 40 h⁰=3 bundles
- |Aut|=2: max_h⁰ up to 17, up to 192 h⁰=3 bundles
- |Aut|=1: max_h⁰ up to 26+, up to 524+ h⁰=3 bundles

**Physical interpretation**: Polytope symmetries constrain the lattice of effective divisors, reducing the degrees of freedom available for line bundle charges. The same rigidity that produces beautiful group theory kills the combinatorial room needed for χ=−6 with h⁰=3. This is a fundamental tension: **flavor symmetry from geometry competes with phenomenological viability from line bundles**.

### Implications

1. **D₆/A₄-level flavor symmetries do not exist** among viable 3-generation candidates
2. **Z₂ is the realistic maximum** for combining symmetry with rich bundle structure
3. The 2+1 generation splitting idea is **transplantable** to Z₂ polytopes (Z₂ acts as parity, splitting generations into even+odd)
4. **h16/P329** is the standout: already scored 26/26 with 228 clean bundles, |Aut|=2, 7 elliptic fibrations, AND 164 h⁰=3 bundles from ALL line bundles
5. **h16/P0** (|Aut|=8) deserves a pipeline run despite only 4 h⁰=3 bundles — the symmetry structure may reveal interesting Yukawa constraints on those few bundles
